React Exercises

##First Exercises: Make a unordered list with react and place it inside a div
- ReactDOM.render will place something on the screen.
- We will make a root div where we can place html items inside.
- We take the reactDOM.render and we insert 2 paramaters (first a html element, second we get the div by id)
