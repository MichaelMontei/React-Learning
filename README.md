# React-Learning
React Exercises

##Exercise 1: Make a unordered list with react and place it inside a div

- ReactDOM.render will place something on the screen.
- We will make a root div where we can place html items inside.
- We take the reactDOM.render and we insert 2 paramaters (first a html element, second we get the div by id)


##Exercise 2: Create your own custom React component

- We create a component and call it "Maincontent" and have it return a simple h1 element that says "I'm Learning React!"
- See exercise2.js 

##Exercise 3: Challenge - recreate the above line of code in vanilla JS by creating and
appending an h1 to our div#root (without using innerHTML).

- See exercise3.js

##Exercise 4: Let's take a look at the differences between console logs in normal JS and JSX used by React.
